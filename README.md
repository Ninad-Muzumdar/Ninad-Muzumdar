It is a platform to convert unstructured documents like images, pdf etc. to editable structured format and extract text from it.

We have used OCR with OpenCV and Pytesseract. The user can upload any unstructured document, we extract the text from document and print it. OCR also provides co-ordinates 
which helps in re-plotting the image in customised and editable format. It can be used by companies to convert an unstructured invoice image received from their client 
to an editable invoice in the standard format of the company. Currently, we are only extracting the text and displaying it. On receiving standard invoice formats, we can train
the system and re-plot the unstructured image into the provided standard format.
